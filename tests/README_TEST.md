Comparing MATLAB and Python versions

These tests are designed to ensure that the MATLAB and Python versions produce reproducible results for the standard version of the algorithm. The orthogonal (FastICA) version is not covered by these tests. Each test compares specific functionality between MATLAB and its corresponding Python implementation. Some tests require an EEG data file that is not included here, but may be downloaded at: https://github.com/sccn/eegprep/blob/develop/data/eeglab_data_with_ica_tmp.set
